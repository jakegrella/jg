        Hey Neighbor, I&apos;m Jake Grella â€” a real estate agent at Keller Williams Los Feliz and a
        software engineer. I take a tech-forward, data-driven approach to real estate which means
        analyzing market trends, optimizing strategy, and providing clear, honest guidance to help
        you make confident decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a background in both corporate and freelance software development, I bring a modern
        mindset to branding, marketing, and client experience. Whether you&apos;re buying, selling,
        or investing, I simplify the process, communicate clearly, and always put your goals first.
      </p>
      <p>
        I care deeply about the communities I serve and am actively building a real estate business
        that blends smart strategy with genuine connection. This is just the beginning, and I&apos;m
        excited to grow alongside the people I work with.
      </p>
