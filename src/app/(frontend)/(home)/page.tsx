          Hey Neighbor, I&apos;m Jake Grella â€” a real estate agent at Keller Williams Los Feliz and
          a software engineer. I take a tech-forward, data-driven approach to real estate which
          means analyzing market trends, optimizing strategy, and providing clear, honest guidance
          to help you make confident decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a background in both corporate and freelance software development, I bring a modern
          mindset to branding, marketing, and client experience. Whether you&apos;re buying,
          selling, or investing, I simplify the process, communicate clearly, and always put your
          goals first.
        </p>
        <p>
          I care deeply about the communities I serve and am actively building a real estate
          business that blends smart strategy with genuine connection. This is just the beginning,
          and I&apos;m excited to grow alongside the people I work with.
